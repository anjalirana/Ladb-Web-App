# Ladbrokes Web Application: The API consumer


- git clone the git Repo

- cd <directory-name>
   
- composer install
 - This is where the app will be asking for parameters including `ladb_api_url` --> this has to be the working uri of LadB API.
 
- php bin/console server:run

- You should now be able to run the app on: `http://localhost:8000/`
